            <li>Wong:</li>
                <p>"Doctor Strange is the best of us. His dedication to mastering the mystic arts and protecting Earth from supernatural threats is unmatched. Weve had our disagreements, but his heart is always in the right place. Hes a natural leader and his ability to remain calm under pressure is what often saves us."</p>
            <li>Dormammu:</li>
                <p>"Strange is a persistent thorn in my side. His meddling in the Dark Dimension is not only bothersome but a direct challenge to my authority. Despite his occasional cleverness and bravery, he is an ant compared to the vast power I command. His attempts to thwart me are but a minor inconvenience."</p>
            <li>Spider-Man (Peter Parker):</li>
                <p>"Strange is like the older, mystical brother I never had. He is got this cool, composed demeanor, but beneath that, he is fiercely protective of those he cares about. I respect his skills and the way he handles magic—he makes it look effortless. Plus, he's saved my bacon more times than I can count."</p>
            <li>Tony Stark (Iron Man): </li>
                <p>"Strange? He is got a flair for the dramatic and a taste for the mystical that I cant always wrap my head around. But lets be honest, when it comes to saving the world, the guy got some serious skills. And while I might not get his whole 'the mystic arts' thing, I know he is a valuable ally. Just wish he lay off the whole time manipulation thing. It gives me a headache."</p>
            <li>Baron Mordo: </li>
                <p>"Doctor Strange represents everything that is wrong with the mystic arts. His arrogance and reliance on his powers have made him a danger to himself and everyone around him. He was a promising student, but his failure to adhere to the true discipline of sorcery has led him to become a misguided figure. His obsession with bending reality will ultimately be his undoing."</p>
            <li>Loki:</li>
                <p>"Ah, the Sorcerer Supreme. Strange likes to fancy himself as some sort of cosmic guardian, doesnt he? While his magic is impressive, it is his constant need to play the hero that makes him so predictable. His meddling with time and dimensions is often more entertaining than effective. I will give him this, though—he does have a knack for showing up at the most inconvenient times."</p>
